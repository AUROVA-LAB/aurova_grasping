## Touch-based Effector Control for 3D Surface Tracking

This repository provides a tactile-based control method for robotic surface tracking using a Kinova Gen3 robotic arm and a PapillArray tactile sensor. The controller regulates both normal contact force and end-effector orientation, enabling the robot to adapt to unknown 3D surfaces for finishing tasks such as polishing and inspection, with special application in the footwear industry.
